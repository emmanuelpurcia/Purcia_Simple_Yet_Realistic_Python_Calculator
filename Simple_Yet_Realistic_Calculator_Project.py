# Hello! I call this program my "Simple Yet Realistic Python Calculator" 
# I chose to do this as my final project in our Programming Logic and Design Subject because I want to know
# How most programmers make a calculator using a software.
# This existing simple calculator project was made by a youtuber named "Parvat Computer Technology"

# pseudocode

# Import Tkinter
import tkinter
from tkinter import *

root.title("My Simple Yet Realistic Python Calculator")
root.geometry("570x600+100+200")
root.resizable(False,False)
