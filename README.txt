# Hello! Welcome to this README File.
# This README File contains all the information you need to know about my Simple Yet Fancy Calculator Python Program.
# This program was made as my Final Project for our Programming Logic and Design Subject for the 1st Semester A.Y 2023-2024.
# This program was also made in order for me to better understand how other people like for example programmers do a calculator software.
# This existing python project idea was made by a youtuber named "Parvat Computer Technology" which can be seen here in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdqUPsDbLLc
