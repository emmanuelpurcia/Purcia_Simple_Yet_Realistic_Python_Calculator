Hello! Welcome to this README File.

This README File contains all the information you need to know about my Simple Yet Fancy Calculator Python Program.

This program was made as my Final Project for our Programming Logic and Design Subject for the 1st Semester A.Y 2023-2024.

This program was also made in order for me to better understand how other people like for example programmers do a calculator software.

This existing python project idea was made by a youtuber named "Parvat Computer Technology" which can be seen here in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdqUPsDbLLc

Credits to the Owner, "Parvat Computer Technology" for giving me an idea to make this project.

The existing python project idea that was made by the youtuber doesn't contain any links for their source code. So, everything you can see in this python program was made and modified from scratch.
 
The following are the Advantages and Disadvantages in doing or using this Simple Yet Fancy Python Calculator Project:
Advantages:
> It can help the beginners/learners to better understand how calculators software was made.
> Beginners/Learners can also have an idea on how they can improved the program.
> The program itself is also useful/helpful if only the user itself only need a simple rather than a more complex calculator.
> By doing such simple python programs like this can make every beginners/learners to honed their skills in coding and making a python program.

Disadvantages:
> Other users may find it lacking due to the fact that python itself have only limited customizations and features rather than any programming languages.
> Some users may often rely on the source code rather than doing this project from scratch.

And that's it! Hope you enjoy and like this project. Bye! :)
